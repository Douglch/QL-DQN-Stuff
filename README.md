# QL-DQN-Stuff

Just following a tutorial from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMk_XtIEzH8&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJFIOU5wDdfy4e9vdnx-7&index=1&ab_channel=sentdex). There are some modified adjustments to my code to make sure the window is rendered correctly.

## Usage

Simply run `python3 main.py` to run the program. You can change the parameters in the `main.py` file to change the number of episodes, the learning rate, and the discount factor. You can also change the `render` variable to `True` to render the window.
